# Competency Task Boost GIL

- Implemented a conv function in the `read_test.cpp` file, which allows convolving an image with a specified filter. The filter can be specified in the file. The images show the results for edge detection using the sobel filter for a grayscale image. The current implementation is supported for jpeg images only.
